An improved version of cfengine syntax highlighting.  I started this syntax highlight before I realize that one already exists.  This scripts doesn't highlight everything, but it highlights sections, classes and identifiers.  It highlights boolean operators in the classes, and highlights the variable operators.  It also handles embedded PHP.  If you use other languages to generate cfengine you can add them into the syntax highlight easily.
